# Tic Tac Toe 
Created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.


### Functionality
This is the [Tic Tac Toe](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/tic-tac-toe) project, which simply lets you play a game of tic tac toe with another person. 


### Thoughts 
This project was a good exercise in writing simple logic in Ruby, and learning to use objects. The trickiest part was finding an elegant way to measure win conditions but everything worked out in the end!
